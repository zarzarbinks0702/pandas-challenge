This project runs an analysis on purchase data from the fictional, free-to-play Heroes of Pymoli mobile game.

The analysis includes a count of the players that made purchases, a count of unique items purchased, how many purchases the players made in total, the average price of each purchase, and the total revenue from all purchases.

It then goes on to gather gender demographics for the players that made purchases and run a purchase analysis based on gender. The gender demographics included a total count of players making purchases by gender and what percentage of these players were each gender (male, female, and other/non-disclosed). The gendered purchase analysis included a count of total purchases made by each gender, the average purchase price, the total purchase value for all purchases made by that gender, and the average purchase total per person of that gender.

Next, the players who made purchases were binned by age and a purchase analysis was run for each age group. The age demographics included a total count of players making purchases by age group and what percentage of the total players each age group represented. The age group purchase analysis included a count of total purchases made by each age, the average purchase price, the total purchase value for all purchases made by that age group, and the average purchase total per person of that age group.

Final analysis were run to find the players who were the top spenders - spending the most money in game, which items were the most popular - purchased the most, and which items were the most profitable - gave the game company the most money for the total purchases of that item.
